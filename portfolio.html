    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a junior at Saint. Francis High School. Before I went to Chandler School. I like to spend my free time hanging out with friends, and playing video games. My favorite game right now is CS:GO, I am better than Mason.
    I also enjoy computers and working with computers a lot, thats why I am taking Computer Science this year. I also want to learn more about medicine because I would like to work as a EMT or a nurse.</p>
